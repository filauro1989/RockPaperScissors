# Rock Paper Scissors game

This is a simple app developed in Svelt.js + Typescript on Vite.

It's deployed on Vercel, you can try it by clicking [here](https://rock-paper-scissors-azure-iota.vercel.app/) or on the link on the right top side of the GitHub page.

I configured this application as a PWA so you can download it on you device and you can use it offline.
